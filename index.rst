Welcome to BookingFor API documentation!
----------------------------------------
The BookingFor API allows developers to expand and build on the BookingFor Platform. The API makes it easy to create web, desktop & mobile applications that directly integrate and interact with your BookingFor subscription.
This API is built around open standards (OData, WCF) to streamline development and maintain the integrity of your data.
